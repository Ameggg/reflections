When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with others when working on projects, so that our changes are kept organized

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To check whether or not we like the changes that others made on the project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks:similar to cloning but it happens on the github website rather than the user's local machine
    Clones:download a copy of the repo. from a webite link onto the user's local machine.
    Branch:we create branches when we want to try expermintal features that we might not want to keep.
    We use forks then cloning instead of direct cloning if we do not permission to change the contents of the forked repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It would then be easier to compare changes that collaborators have made to the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Uploading updated files to google drive and informing others about it, they would check the changes and if they agree they would download it. This way is less efficient than using git and github as we are going through many interfaces, while we can just use the bash cmd to control all of the version-control system.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
